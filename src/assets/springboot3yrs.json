    {
      "q1": "Q1. Describe the internal working of the Spring Boot auto-configuration feature.",
      "a1": "Spring Boot's auto-configuration works by checking for specific classes in the classpath and then creating beans based on certain conditions. It uses the @Conditional annotation along with conditions to decide if a bean should be created or not. The process is driven by the spring.factories file where all auto-configurations are listed."
    },
    {
      "q2": "Q2. How do you handle database migrations in a Spring Boot application?",
      "a2": "Database migrations can be managed using tools like Flyway or Liquibase. When integrated with Spring Boot, these tools can automatically apply schema changes during application startup, ensuring that the database schema is always synchronized with the application's expectations."
    },
    {
      "q3": "Q3. Explain how Spring Boot achieves database connection pooling. How would you configure a different connection pool?",
      "a3": "Spring Boot uses HikariCP as the default connection pooling library when it's on the classpath. You can switch to another pooling solution (like Tomcat or DBCP2) by excluding HikariCP and including the desired dependency. Pool settings can be adjusted in application.properties."
    },
    {
      "q4": "Q4. Discuss the advantages and drawbacks of using JPA in your Spring Boot applications.",
      "a4": "Advantages include abstracting database interactions, providing an object-oriented API, and handling boilerplate CRUD operations. Drawbacks might be performance overhead, complexity in handling native queries, and sometimes leading to N+1 query problems."
    },
    {
      "q5": "Q5. How can you handle caching in a Spring Boot application?",
      "a5": "Spring Boot supports caching abstraction. By adding the cache starter (spring-boot-starter-cache) and enabling caching with @EnableCaching, various caching operations can be performed using annotations like @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict. For actual caching storage, solutions like EhCache, Redis, or Caffeine can be used."
    },
    {
      "q6": "Q6. Explain how Spring Boot simplifies microservices development.",
      "a6": "Spring Boot, especially when integrated with Spring Cloud, provides tools and conventions for creating, discovering, routing, and managing microservices. Features like centralized configuration, service discovery, client-side load balancing, and circuit breakers simplify microservice patterns."

    {
      "q7": "Q7. Describe an instance where you had to troubleshoot a performance issue in your Spring Boot application. How did you diagnose and resolve it?",
      "a7": "This question is scenario-based. A good response might involve using profiling tools, identifying bottlenecks (like slow database queries or inefficient algorithms), and applying optimizations."
    },
    {
      "q8": "Q8. How would you secure sensitive properties or secrets in your Spring Boot applications?",
      "a8": "Sensitive information can be encrypted using Spring's property-level encryption or integrated with external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault. Another approach is to use environment variables or orchestration secrets management (like Kubernetes secrets)."
    },
    {
      "q9": "Q9. Describe the process of integrating a Spring Boot application with a CI/CD pipeline.",
      "a9": "Integrating Spring Boot with CI/CD involves setting up a source code repository webhook to a CI/CD tool (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions), creating a build script that compiles, tests, and packages the application, and deploying it to an environment. Automated tests, code quality checks, and other validations can be added to the pipeline."
    },
    {
      "q10": "Q10. How do you handle session management in a distributed Spring Boot application?",
      "a10": "In distributed setups, session replication can be achieved using external session stores like Redis or Hazelcast. Spring Session provides the necessary integrations to offload session data to these stores, ensuring consistency across multiple application instances."
    },
    {
      "q11": "Q11. How can you optimize a Spring Boot application's startup time?",
      "a11": "Optimizing startup time can involve:\n\nReducing the number of auto-configurations and beans.\nLazily initializing beans.\nUsing JVM arguments for optimized garbage collection and memory management.\nAvoiding classpath scanning where possible.\nPrecomputing data that might be computed at startup."
    },
    
      {
        "q12": "Q12. How would you implement authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application?",
        "a12": "Authentication and authorization can be implemented using Spring Security. It provides form-based login, HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth2, and more. Authorization can be managed using roles and privileges. Annotations like @PreAuthorize and @Secured can be used to enforce authorization at the method level."

        "a15": "Spring Boot integrates seamlessly with JSR-303 and JSR-380 Bean Validation APIs. By annotating domain or DTO objects with validation constraints like @NotNull, @Size, and using @Valid on controller methods, you can trigger validation. Errors can be captured using a BindingResult or custom exception handlers."

      {
        "q19": "Q19. What strategies do you employ for database transaction management in Spring Boot?",
        "a19": "Spring Boot provides declarative transaction management using @Transactional annotation. When a method annotated with @Transactional is triggered, Spring ensures that it runs within a transactional context, either using an existing transaction or creating a new one. Propagation levels and rollback conditions can be specified using the annotation attributes."

          "q20": "Q20. How does Spring Boot simplify exception handling for RESTful services?",
          "a20": "Spring Boot offers the @ControllerAdvice annotation to handle exceptions globally. Paired with @ExceptionHandler, it allows centralized handling of specific exceptions. Spring Boot also includes ResponseEntityExceptionHandler, a base class that can be extended to handle standard Spring exceptions and translate them to HTTP status codes."
