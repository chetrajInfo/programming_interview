       "a1":"Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications. It provides default configurations, eliminates boilerplate code, and offers a way to quickly get started with Spring. It's useful because it accelerates application development, reduces common pitfalls, and simplifies deployment.It simplifies the process of building production-ready applications. Key benefits include: \nAuto-configuration: Reduces the need for specifying beans in the configuration file. \nStandalone: Web servers can be embedded in the application. This makes applications easy to deploy and reduces the need for external servers. \nProduction Ready: Provides health checks and metrics, which can be monitored in real-time."

        "a2":"Both annotations are used for dependency injection in Spring. \n@Autowired: It's Spring's own annotation. It can be used to autowire bean on setter methods, instance variables, and constructors. By default, it uses type-based injection. \n@Resource: This is a part of the JSR-250 specification. It uses name-based autowiring. It can be mentioned using the 'name' attribute."
