          Preparing for a Core Java interview, focus on solidifying your understanding of foundational concepts such as object-oriented programming principles, Java data types, strings, and arrays. Brush up on exception handling, generics, and the Collections Framework. Be able to explain the significance of Java Virtual Machine (JVM), just-in-time (JIT) compiler, garbage collection, and how Java achieves platform independence. It's also beneficial to understand the concurrency API, as well as new features introduced in the latest Java releases. Practice writing clean, efficient code and be prepared to discuss your approach to problem-solving using Java.
